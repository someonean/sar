# How to compile it
Since this project is made of a single C file, it doesn't need a makefile.
It can be compiled directly with a C compiler.
On unix and unix-like operating systems it's compiled with the command 'cc':
cc sar.c -o sar
If it doesn't work install a C compiler from your package managment system or try 'gcc' instead.
On other operating systems you could download and install a C IDE and then copy the code from this project in the IDE, and then compile it.
